# install-visor-calibration.sh - Download and install VISOR mission calibration
#
# Runs inside a docker build (visor/Dockerfile and fullfeatured/Dockerfile both
# use it), so it is /bin/sh only and takes its inputs from the environment:
#
#   VISOR_CALIB               destination root; one directory per mission
#   VISOR_CHECKSUMS           file of pinned "<sha256>  <asset>" lines
#   VICAR_VERSION             VICAR release the calibration assets belong to
#   VISOR_CALIBRATION_DATE    date stamp in the asset names
#   VISOR_SPLIT_SUFFIXES      suffixes probed when an asset is split
#
# Usage: install-visor-calibration.sh <mission>...
#
# Download, verify, extract and delete the archives in one pass: compressed
# calibration is the same order of magnitude as extracted calibration, so
# keeping the downloads would nearly double the image. Every part is checked
# against its pinned digest before anything is extracted, and an asset with no
# pinned digest fails the build.
